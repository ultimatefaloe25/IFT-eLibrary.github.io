        <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY e-Library (IFT) has a history of cooperating with research projects that use the
                collections, services, and usage information of the IFT as objects of study themselves (in contrast to the
                general support of scholarship that the IFT collections and services provide). In general these uses have
                been to the benefit of system wide library and IFT planning and to SICT scholarship in information services
                and digital libraries, and in principle such cooperation should continue to be supported.
                However, the IFT believes some structure and oversight governing these cooperative research ventures
                is preferable to informal arrangements. This is necessary for at least the following reasons:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>IFT resources, including digital objects, data, IT infrastructure, and staff time, are SICT assets
                    created and allocated to support the IFT and University missions. Whether research is
                    conducted in a controlled environment or through the open Internet these SICT-owned or managed
                    resources must be protected and their research use appropriately managed as dictated by SICT
                    policies, state and federal laws, and professional ethics.
                </li>
                <li>Staff time to support these projects can be substantial and must be prioritized and managed by
                    the IFT administration.
                </li>
                <li> IFT requires a well-documented record of its contributions to the SICT research enterprise.</li>
                <li>IFT contributions to research should be appropriately acknowledged and publicized.</li>
                
            </ol>

            <br><br>
             <h2>IFT contributions to research should be appropriately acknowledged and publicized.</h2>
                <b>Principles</b>
            <p>
                Research use of IFT resources1
            should be governed by the following principles:
            </p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Research use must not threaten the inherent value of IFT resources, nor interfere with service
                    commitments or with development activities; research use must be suspended immediately upon
                    request from the IFT if there is evidence of such interference.</li>
                <li>Because of the openness of the Internet, the IFT may choose to limit sharing some types of data
                    when researchers propose using what may be the intellectual property of the SICT campuses.</li>
                <li>Required IFT staff support must be estimated and approved by appropriate supervisors before
                    the project starts. The IFT may request specifications from the research team in order to
                    determine the level of staff support and may require that the research team use grant or other
                    fund sources to support IFT staff time.</li>
                <li>Results should be shared with IFT and relevant partners</li>
                <li>Attribution to the IFT (and relevant others) should be made in any publications or presentations.</li>
                <li>Research use must abide by IFT policies and relevant laws and professional codes of conduct.
                    Illustrative examples include, but are not limited to, evidence of following SICT Human Subjects
                    protocol when direct contact with users is involved and of protection of privacy (for example, in
                    the analysis of usage logs).</li>
            </ol>
            <b>Procedures</b>
            <p>
                Evidence that these principles have been considered and addressed will normally require a written
            proposal to and response from the IFT Executive Director. The IFT reserves the right to ask for
            modifications to proposed research or to withhold permission for the use of IFT resources based upon
            the principles above.
